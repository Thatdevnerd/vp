# VPN Application Architecture

## Overview

This VPN application is built using a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns and provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Core Layer (VPNCore)

The core layer contains all the fundamental VPN functionality:

#### Models
- **VPNConfiguration**: Configuration settings for both server and client
- **VPNPacket**: Represents VPN packets with different types (Handshake, Data, KeepAlive)
- **VPNConnectionStatus**: Enumeration of connection states
- **VPNClientInfo**: Information about connected clients
- **VPNServerInfo**: Server status and statistics

#### Interfaces
- **IVPNServer**: Contract for VPN server implementations
- **IVPNClient**: Contract for VPN client implementations
- **IVPNTunnel**: Contract for network tunnel implementations
- **IVPNCryptography**: Contract for cryptographic operations

#### Cryptography
- **VPNCryptography**: Implements encryption, decryption, key generation, and digital signatures
- Uses .NET's built-in cryptography libraries (AES-CBC, ECDH, RSA)

#### Networking
- **VPNTunnel**: Manages TUN/TAP network interfaces
- **VPNProtocol**: Handles packet serialization and network communication
- **IPAddressPool**: Manages virtual IP address allocation

#### Utilities
- **NetworkUtils**: Network utility functions for IP validation, connectivity checks, etc.

### 2. Server Layer (VPNServer)

The server application that handles multiple client connections:

#### VPNServerService
- Implements `IVPNServer` interface
- Manages client connections and authentication
- Handles packet routing between clients
- Provides server statistics and monitoring

#### Features
- Multi-client support with connection pooling
- Virtual IP address assignment
- Packet encryption and routing
- Connection monitoring and cleanup
- Configurable server settings

### 3. Client Layer (VPNClient)

Console-based VPN client application:

#### VPNClientService
- Implements `IVPNClient` interface
- Handles connection to VPN server
- Manages local tunnel interface
- Provides connection status events

#### Features
- Command-line interface
- Automatic reconnection
- Connection status monitoring
- Configurable client settings

### 4. GUI Layer (VPNClient.GUI)

Windows Forms-based graphical client:

#### MainForm
- User-friendly interface for VPN connection
- Real-time connection status display
- Server configuration management
- Connection logs and monitoring

#### Features
- Easy-to-use graphical interface
- Connection status visualization
- Server settings management
- Real-time logging

### 5. Testing Layer (Tests)

Unit and integration tests:

#### Test Coverage
- Cryptography operations
- Network utilities
- Configuration validation
- Protocol handling

## Data Flow

### Connection Establishment

1. **Client Initiation**
   - Client creates VPN configuration
   - Initiates connection to server
   - Sends handshake packet

2. **Server Authentication**
   - Server receives handshake
   - Performs key exchange (ECDH)
   - Assigns virtual IP address
   - Sends handshake response

3. **Tunnel Creation**
   - Client creates TUN/TAP interface
   - Configures virtual IP and routing
   - Establishes encrypted tunnel

4. **Data Transfer**
   - Client captures network packets
   - Encrypts and sends to server
   - Server decrypts and routes packets
   - Bidirectional data flow established

### Packet Processing

```
[Application] → [TUN/TAP] → [VPNClient] → [Encryption] → [Network] → [VPNServer] → [Decryption] → [Routing] → [Internet]
```

## Security Architecture

### Encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC for data encryption
- **Key Exchange**: Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
- **Authentication**: Digital signatures using RSA
- **Integrity**: HMAC for packet authentication

### Key Management
- Ephemeral keys for each session
- Automatic key rotation
- Secure key storage
- Perfect forward secrecy

### Network Security
- Virtual IP isolation
- Traffic encapsulation
- Firewall integration
- DNS leak protection

## Configuration Management

### Server Configuration
```json
{
  "VPN": {
    "ServerPort": 1194,
    "Protocol": "UDP",
    "VirtualNetworkAddress": "10.8.0.0",
