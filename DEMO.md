# VPN Application Demo

## Overview

This is a complete, production-ready VPN application written in C# with the following features:

### Core Features
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Military-grade encryption with authenticated encryption
- **RSA-2048 Key Exchange**: Secure key establishment between client and server
- **UDP Transport**: High-performance networking with minimal overhead
- **Session Management**: Multi-client support with automatic session cleanup
- **Data Compression**: Optional GZip compression to reduce bandwidth
- **Keep-Alive Monitoring**: Automatic detection of disconnected clients
- **Virtual IP Assignment**: Dynamic IP allocation for VPN clients

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separated into core library, server, and client components
- **Interface-Based**: Extensible design with pluggable crypto and transport providers
- **Thread-Safe**: Concurrent handling of multiple clients
- **Configuration-Driven**: JSON-based configuration with sensible defaults

### Security Features
- **Forward Secrecy**: Each session uses unique encryption keys
- **Replay Protection**: Sequence numbers prevent replay attacks
- **Authentication**: HMAC-SHA256 ensures packet integrity
- **Secure Random**: Cryptographically secure key and IV generation

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Windows (for GUI client) or Linux/macOS (for console applications)

### Build
```bash
dotnet build
```

### Run Tests
```bash
dotnet test
```

### Start VPN Server
```bash
cd VPNServer
dotnet run
```

### Start Console Client
```bash
cd VPNClient
dotnet run
```

### Start GUI Client (Windows only)
```bash
cd VPNClient.GUI
dotnet run
```

## Configuration

### Server Configuration (appsettings.json)
```json
{
  "VPNConfiguration": {
    "ServerPort": 1194,
    "MaxClients": 100,
    "SessionTimeoutMinutes": 30,
    "VirtualNetworkCIDR": "10.8.0.0/24",
    "CompressData": true,
    "LogLevel": "Information"
  }
}
```

### Client Configuration (appsettings.json)
```json
{
  "VPNConfiguration": {
    "ServerAddress": "127.0.0.1",
    "ServerPort": 1194,
    "CompressData": true,
    "LogLevel": "Information"
  }
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput**: Optimized for high-speed data transfer
- **Latency**: Minimal overhead with UDP transport
- **Memory**: Efficient packet pooling and resource management
- **CPU**: Hardware-accelerated cryptography when available
- **Scalability**: Supports 100+ concurrent clients per server

## Security Considerations

### Encryption
- AES-256-GCM provides both confidentiality and authenticity
- Unique initialization vectors for each packet
- 128-bit authentication tags prevent tampering

### Key Management
- RSA-2048 for initial key exchange
- Ephemeral session keys for forward secrecy
- Secure key derivation using HMAC-SHA256

### Network Security
- UDP transport with built-in packet authentication
- Session isolation prevents cross-contamination
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

## Deployment Options

### Standalone Deployment
- Self-contained executables
- No external dependencies
- Portable across platforms

### Service Deployment
- Windows Service support
- Linux systemd integration
- Docker containerization ready

### Enterprise Features
- Configuration management
- Centralized logging
- Performance monitoring
- Load balancing support

## Extensibility

The application is designed for extensibility:

- **Transport Layer**: Easy to add TCP or other protocols
- **Cryptography**: Pluggable encryption algorithms
- **Compression**: Support for different compression methods
- **Authentication**: Extensible authentication mechanisms

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite includes:
- Unit tests for cryptographic operations
- Session management testing
- Network transport validation
- Integration testing scenarios

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Cross-platform GUI using Avalonia
- Database backend for session persistence
- REST API for management
- Plugin architecture for extensions
- Advanced routing capabilities
- Quality of Service (QoS) features
