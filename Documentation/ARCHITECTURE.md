# VPN Application Architecture

## Overview

This VPN application is built using a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns and provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios. The application consists of four main components:

1. **VPNCore** - Core library with shared functionality
2. **VPNServer** - Server application for handling client connections
3. **VPNClient** - Console client application
4. **VPNClient.GUI** - Windows Forms GUI client

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Core Layer (VPNCore)

The core layer provides the fundamental building blocks for the VPN functionality:

#### Models
- **VPNConfiguration**: Configuration settings for both server and client
- **VPNPacket**: Base packet structure with different packet types
- **VPNSession**: Session management and state tracking
- **VPNSessionManager**: Thread-safe session management

#### Cryptography
- **ICryptoProvider**: Interface for cryptographic operations
- **AESGCMCryptoProvider**: AES-256-GCM encryption implementation
- **ICompressionProvider**: Interface for data compression
- **GZipCompressionProvider**: GZip compression implementation

#### Networking
- **IVPNTransport**: Interface for network transport
- **UDPVPNTransport**: UDP-based transport implementation
- Event-driven architecture for packet handling

#### Processing
- **VPNPacketProcessor**: Packet encryption, decryption, and processing
- Handles compression, authentication, and sequencing

### 2. Server Layer (VPNServer)

The server layer implements the VPN server functionality:

#### VPNServerService
- Background service that manages client connections
- Handles handshake, key exchange, and data routing
- Manages virtual IP address pool
- Automatic session cleanup

#### Features
- Multi-client support
- Session-based encryption
- Keep-alive monitoring
- Configurable through JSON

### 3. Client Layer (VPNClient)

The client layer provides VPN client functionality:

#### VPNClientService
- Manages connection to VPN server
- Handles authentication and key exchange
- Processes incoming/outgoing data
- Automatic reconnection

#### Features
- Command-line interface
- Configurable server settings
- Real-time connection status
- Keep-alive mechanism

### 4. GUI Layer (VPNClient.GUI)

The GUI layer provides a user-friendly interface:

#### MainForm
- Windows Forms application
- Real-time connection status
- Configuration management
- Statistics display
- Log viewer

## Data Flow

### Connection Establishment

1. **Client Initiation**
   - Client starts transport layer
   - Generates RSA key pair
   - Sends handshake packet to server

2. **Server Response**
   - Server receives handshake
   - Creates new session
   - Generates server key pair
   - Sends key exchange packet

3. **Key Exchange**
   - Client receives server public key
   - Both parties derive session keys
   - Encryption keys established

4. **Configuration**
   - Server assigns virtual IP
   - Sends configuration to client
   - Connection established

### Data Transmission

1. **Outgoing Data**
   - Application data → Compression (optional)
   - Compressed data → Encryption (AES-GCM)
   - Encrypted data → Authentication (HMAC)
   - Authenticated packet → Network transport

2. **Incoming Data**
   - Network transport → Authentication verification
   - Authenticated data → Decryption
   - Decrypted data → Decompression (if needed)
   - Original data → Application

## Security Architecture

### Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM**: Provides confidentiality and authenticity
- **Unique IVs**: Each packet uses a unique initialization vector
- **Session Keys**: Generated per connection for forward secrecy

### Authentication
- **HMAC-SHA256**: Ensures packet integrity
- **Sequence Numbers**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Session Isolation**: Each session has unique keys

### Key Management
- **RSA-2048**: Initial key exchange
- **Ephemeral Keys**: Session keys are temporary
- **Secure Random**: Cryptographically secure key generation

## Threading Model

### Server Threading
- **Main Thread**: Handles service lifecycle
- **Network Thread**: Processes incoming packets
- **Cleanup Thread**: Removes expired sessions
- **Per-Session Processing**: Concurrent packet handling

### Client Threading
- **Main Thread**: User interface (GUI) or console
- **Network Thread**: Handles server communication
- **Keep-Alive Thread**: Sends periodic keep-alive packets

## Error Handling

### Network Errors
- Automatic reconnection attempts
- Graceful degradation on packet loss
- Timeout handling for unresponsive connections

### Cryptographic Errors
- Secure error reporting (no key leakage)
- Automatic session termination on auth failures
- Proper cleanup of cryptographic resources

### Application Errors
- Comprehensive logging at multiple levels
- User-friendly error messages in GUI
- Graceful shutdown procedures

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
